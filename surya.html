      FPA provides a standardized method to functionally size the software work product. This work product is the output of software new development and improvement projects for subsequent releases. It is the software that is relocated to the production application at project implementation. It measures functionality from the userâ€™s point of view i.e. on the basis of what the user requests and receives in return.

        <h3>weight is collected from the user</h3>
       <h3>3)Total line of code is product of weight and average of each module</h3>  
       <h3>4)FP/PM and Labour rate will also be collected from user</h3>        
       <h3>5)COST/FP is calculated by dividing labour rate and FP/PM</h3>

       <h3> Many cost and effort models are based on LOC, so it is necessary to change the function points.</h3> 
       <h3> Compared to LOC, there are less research data on function points.</h3>
       <h3>This is a very time-consuming method.</h3>
